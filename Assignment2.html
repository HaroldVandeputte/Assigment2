<h3> Yesterday Evening  </h3>
<p> Jonas and Harold took together the train sunday evening because they had a lecture monday morning at 8AM. But Harold was very stuborn and did not want to go. So Jonas showed some mercy and changed the plans and they would reserve a room and start at 9AM. </p>

<h3> 9AM  </h3>
<p> When Jonas got there on time he noticed that his 'teammate' wasn't there. So he had to work alone in a room of the faculty philosophy. That faculty was dangurous because the danger was pried behind every corner.</p>
<h3> Harold got there too late  </h3>
<p> When harold found the room it was to late. Jonas was already eaten alive. There was no sign anymore of the phylosophers. Only his head was still in tackt. </p>
<h3> Guilt  </h3>
<p> Harold felt the guilt hole his life and was never happy again. </p>
